## Need of Blockchain
Using blockchain, voting process can be made more secure, transparent, immutable, and reliable. A blockchain-based voting application does not concern itself with the security of its Internet connection, because any hacker with access to the terminal will not be able to affect other nodes. Voters can effectively submit their vote without revealing their identity or political preferences to the public. Officials can count votes with absolute certainty, knowing that each ID can be attributed to one vote, no fakes can be created, and that tampering is impossible.

## What we have developed?
A Decentralized Application (Dapp) running on the Ethereum blockchain and client side as a React JS application.
All the contract code is written in solidity language which is used to deploy contract in blockchain platform.
This application can be used by Election Commission (officials responsible for conducting Elections) as well as Voters. 
- The officials can control the election process by
  - Verifying the eligible voters
  - Adding the list of candidates that are standing for the election
  - Start or End voting phase (time during which the voters can cast their vote)
  - See or display the results of election.
- The voters can participate in the election process by
  - Registering themselves for the voting
  - Viewing the list of candidates
  - Casting their vote

### What we have used?
- Truffle
- Ganache
- Metamask
- Solidity
- Web3 JS
- React JS
